# ATM Machine Project
> MIT xPRO - Week 15

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course taken.

## Description

A basic project to create an ATM Machine. The ATM will allow the user to track his bank balance by offering the functionality of both inserting positive values for deposits and negative withdrawals. Once a value is inserted an updated balance will be shown. If the customer overdraws he will get an alert saying that he has insufficient funds.

### Features

* A fully functional ATM machine

## Installation

Clone the files that are in the ATM-Machine directory to your local machine.
A local server is needed to run the test React applications.
To do this complete the following steps:
- Download Live Server extension in VS code OR
- Download http-server via terminal using `npm install --global http-server` from https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
- Run a new terminal window within that folder and launch the React app via `http-server -c-1` 
- `-c-1` is used to stop the page from caching
- Once is it running, you can open your browser and navigate to the following site:
    - http://127.0.0.1:8080     
- To quit the application you can use `Ctrl + c`


## Usage
